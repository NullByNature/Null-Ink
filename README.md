# 🕶️ NullInk - Text Obfuscator (C# Console App)

**NullInk** is a simple text-blurring tool built in C# as an early step in my progression toward building more advanced security and encryption applications. The purpose of this project is to practice file handling, character manipulation, and input validation — all foundational concepts needed before jumping into real cryptography.

---

## 🔍 What It Does

- Replaces every letter in a string with `*` (or another chosen symbol)
- Preserves spaces, punctuation, and numbers
- Outputs the blurred result to the console

---

## 🧠 Why It Exists

This project is part of a learning path leading up to my file encryption tool **NullCrypt**.  
I'm using NullInk to build confidence with:
- String and character handling
- Basic obfuscation logic
- Input validation and clean user flow
- Preparing for real-world concepts like byte-level file encryption

## 📦 Features (So Far)

- Validates that user input is not blank
- Replaces letters with a blur symbol
- Outputs obfuscated text to console

---

## 🚧 Planned Features

- [ ] Option to save blurred output to a file
- [ ] User-defined blur symbol
- [ ] Ability to blur entire files, not just typed input
- [ ] GUI version (WinForms or WPF)
- [ ] Integration with NullCrypt in the future
